Install the Man Page:

To make your custom man page available, you need to place the generated man page file in the appropriate directory where man pages are stored. The standard location is /usr/local/share/man/man1/ for user-specific pages. You may need root or superuser permissions to install it system-wide.

To install it for a single user (assuming your custom page is named internsctl.1):

bash
Copy code
mkdir -p ~/.local/share/man/man1/
mv internsctl.1 ~/.local/share/man/man1/
Update Man Database:

After installing the man page, you should update the man page database for it to be recognized by the man command:

bash
Copy code
mandb
View Your Manual Page:

You can now view your custom man page using the man command:

bash
Copy code
man internsctl
This will display your custom manual page, and users can access it just like any other man page.
